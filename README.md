# Makerspace Digital Design Archive

This repository is intended to be used as an archive for designs made with Luddy Makerspace equipment in mind. Members of the Luddy Makerspace Technician Team can commit new designs at any time as long as they are in a finished state.

# Repo Organization

There are two main directorys intended to be used, those being digital-designs and fabrication. digital-designs is intended for files that aren't designed for any particular piece of equipment. An example of this kind of design could be a Logo made originally for a website but could be used in other ways. fabrication is where you would put designs intended to be run on the Laser Cutter, 3D Printer, Vinyl Cutter, etc.

Each directory has its own set of subdirectory. One off designs that are a single file and don't fit into any of the established categories should be put in misc while larger projects making use of multiple files can have their own subdirectory.

The file naming scheme only has a couple of rules to it. All files should take on the lowercase-hyphenated format (example: project-stl-file.stl). For illustrator files, you must also add two letters at the beginning to indicate the intended machine (vc: Vinyl Cutter, lc: Laser Cutter).

While these repo rules may seem kind of strict for what is essentially just a design archive, they've been put in place because this is intended to be a more long-term directory. When you submit a repo commit, please consider that someone else a few years from now may come across your design and want to run it. For complex jobs, they may not have your specific though process in mind when looking at the design file, so consider adding a README explaining how to run the file on Makerspace Equipment. 

# Illustrator File Notes

Illustrator files can be run on multiple Makerspace Machines, so I've added this key to the naming scheme to help with this.

| Filename    | Intended Machine |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| vc-<filename>.ai | Vinyl Cutter |
| lc-<filename>.ai | Laser Cutter |
